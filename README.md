# FPGA-based RISC-V processor

## Installing Vivado

Download the installer for the latest version, mark it as executable, and run it:

```bash
chmod u+x Xilinx_Unified_2022.2_1014_8888_Lin64.bin
./Xilinx_Unified_2022.2_1014_8888_Lin64.bin
```

Ignore the warning about unsupported OS if you get it (tested on Linux Mint 20.1 Cinnamon). Put in your login details, and progress to install Vivado. Choose to install Vivado ML Standard. Choose the devices you want to install (at least Artix-7), and progress to choose an install location. By installing less devices, the download size and disk space requirement will be minimised. Pick `/tools/Xilinx` and begin the download/install.
